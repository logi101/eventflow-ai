## Overview
Comprehensive guide for editing English text, covering grammar, punctuation, spelling, style, and common errors.

## Grammar Fundamentals

### Parts of Speech

**Nouns:**
- Person, place, thing, or idea
- Proper nouns: capitalized (John, Paris, Monday)
- Common nouns: lowercase (book, city, day)

**Verbs:**
- Action or state of being
- Tense: past, present, future
- Voice: active vs. passive

**Adjectives:**
- Describe nouns
- Order: opinion, size, age, shape, color, origin, material, purpose
- Example: "beautiful large old round red Italian wooden dining table"

**Adverbs:**
- Modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs
- Often end in -ly
- Placement matters for clarity

### Sentence Structure

**Simple Sentence:**
- One independent clause
- Example: "The cat sleeps."

**Compound Sentence:**
- Two independent clauses joined by conjunction
- Example: "The cat sleeps, and the dog plays."

**Complex Sentence:**
- Independent clause + dependent clause
- Example: "The cat sleeps when it's tired."

**Compound-Complex:**
- Multiple independent + dependent clauses
- Example: "The cat sleeps when it's tired, and the dog plays outside."

### Subject-Verb Agreement

**Basic Rule:**
- Singular subject → singular verb
- Plural subject → plural verb

**Examples:**
- ✓ The book is on the table.
- ✓ The books are on the table.
- ❌ The books is on the table.

**Tricky Cases:**
- Collective nouns: "The team is winning" (US) vs. "The team are winning" (UK)
- "None": Can be singular or plural depending on context
- Subjects with "or/nor": Verb agrees with nearest subject

### Verb Tenses

**Present:**
- Simple: "I write"
- Continuous: "I am writing"
- Perfect: "I have written"
- Perfect Continuous: "I have been writing"

**Past:**
- Simple: "I wrote"
- Continuous: "I was writing"
- Perfect: "I had written"
- Perfect Continuous: "I had been writing"

**Future:**
- Simple: "I will write"
- Continuous: "I will be writing"
- Perfect: "I will have written"
- Perfect Continuous: "I will have been writing"

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Active Voice:**
- Subject performs the action
- Example: "The cat caught the mouse."
- Preferred for clarity and directness

**Passive Voice:**
- Subject receives the action
- Example: "The mouse was caught by the cat."
- Use sparingly; appropriate when:
  - Actor is unknown: "The window was broken."
  - Actor is irrelevant: "Mistakes were made."
  - Emphasizing the action: "The book was published in 1984."

## Punctuation Rules

### Period (.)
- End of declarative sentence
- After abbreviations: Dr., Mr., etc.
- In ellipsis: ... (three dots)

### Comma (,)
**Uses:**
- Separate items in list: "apples, oranges, and bananas"
- After introductory elements: "After dinner, we watched TV."
- Between independent clauses with conjunction: "I ran, but she walked."
- Set off non-essential information: "My brother, who lives in Boston, is visiting."
- After transitional phrases: "However, I disagree."

**Oxford Comma:**
- Serial comma before "and" in list
- US style: generally use it
- UK style: varies by publisher
- Example: "red, white, and blue" vs. "red, white and blue"

### Semicolon (;)
**Uses:**
- Join related independent clauses: "I came; I saw; I conquered."
- Separate complex list items: "We visited Paris, France; Rome, Italy; and Berlin, Germany."

### Colon (:)
**Uses:**
- Introduce list: "Buy three items: milk, eggs, bread."
- Introduce explanation: "Here's the problem: we're out of time."
- Time notation: 3:45 PM

### Apostrophe (')
**Uses:**
- Possessive: "John's book", "the dogs' toys"

- Special plurals: "dot your i's"

**Common Errors:**
- ❌ "its'" (doesn't exist)
- ❌ "it's" for possessive (should be "its")
- ✓ "it's" = "it is"
- ✓ "its" = possessive

### Quotation Marks (" ")
**Uses:**
- Direct quotes: She said, "Hello."
- Titles of short works: "The Road Not Taken"
- Irony or scare quotes: He's "brilliant"

**Placement with Other Punctuation:**
- US style: Periods and commas inside quotes
