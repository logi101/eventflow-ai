# Style and Voice Consistency Guidelines

## Overview
Maintaining consistent style and voice throughout a manuscript is crucial for professional, readable content. This guide covers terminology, tone, narrative consistency, and strategies for ensuring uniformity across long documents.

## Understanding Style vs. Voice

### Voice
- **Definition**: The unique personality and perspective of the author or narrator
- **Elements**: Word choice, sentence structure, attitude, personality
- **Consistency**: Should remain stable throughout the work
- **Example**: Formal vs. casual, humorous vs. serious, personal vs. detached

### Style
- **Definition**: The specific choices in grammar, punctuation, formatting, and conventions
- **Elements**: Spelling conventions, punctuation choices, capitalization, formatting
- **Consistency**: Must be maintained rigidly
- **Example**: Oxford comma usage, US vs. UK spelling, date formats

## Terminology Consistency

### Creating a Terminology Glossary

**Purpose:**
- Ensure consistent use of terms throughout document
- Especially important for:
  - Character names and titles
  - Place names
  - Technical terms
  - Invented words (sci-fi, fantasy)
  - Brand names or product names

**Glossary Contents:**
1. **Term/Name**: The preferred spelling
2. **Variations**: Acceptable alternatives (nicknames, abbreviations)
3. **Context**: When to use each variation
4. **First Appearance**: Where introduced in text

**Example Glossary Entry:**
```
Term: Elisabeth
Variations: Liz (informal, by friends), Elisa (by family), Ms. Johnson (formal)
Context: "Elisabeth" in narration, variations in dialogue
First use: Chapter 1, page 3
```

### Character Names

**Consistency Checklist:**
- [ ] Spelling never varies (unless intentional)
- [ ] Nicknames used consistently by same characters
- [ ] Titles used appropriately (Dr., Ms., Mr.)
- [ ] Name changes (marriage, etc.) tracked clearly
- [ ] Foreign names spelled consistently

**Common Issues:**
- ❌ "Sara" becoming "Sarah" mid-book
- ❌ Inconsistent hyphenation: "Mary-Anne" vs. "Mary Anne"
- ❌ Nickname usage varying randomly

### Place Names

**Guidelines:**
- Real places: Use official spellings
- Fictional places: Document spelling precisely
- Descriptive terms: Be consistent ("the city" vs. "the City")
- Foreign places: Choose transliteration and stick to it

### Technical Terms and Jargon

**Consistency Requirements:**
- Choose one term for each concept
- Don't alternate between synonyms randomly
- If introducing new term, explain once clearly
- Create acronym/abbreviation list

**Example:**
- Choose one: "smartphone" vs. "smart phone" vs. "Smartphone"
- Choose one: "email" vs. "e-mail" vs. "Email"
- Document decision and apply universally

## Tone Consistency

### Identifying Tone

**Common Tones:**
- **Formal**: Academic, professional, detached
- **Informal**: Conversational, friendly, personal
- **Humorous**: Witty, playful, ironic
- **Serious**: Somber, earnest, grave
- **Optimistic**: Positive, hopeful, uplifting
- **Cynical**: Skeptical, sarcastic, jaded
- **Neutral**: Objective, balanced, factual

### Maintaining Tone

**Within Sections:**
- Narrative voice should maintain consistent tone
- Dialogue can vary by character
- Internal thoughts should match character personality

**Shifts in Tone:**
- Intentional shifts: Mark clearly with chapter/section breaks
- Unintentional shifts: Flag and revise for consistency
- Gradual evolution: Ensure it's gradual and motivated

**Red Flags:**
- Sudden formality changes
- Inconsistent humor (serious → joking → serious)
- Tonal mismatch with content (flippant about serious topics)

## Point of View (POV) Consistency

### POV Types

**First Person (I/we):**
- Single narrator perspective
- Intimate, limited knowledge
- Strong voice required
- Example: "I walked into the room."

**Second Person (you):**
- Rare in long-form
- Direct address to reader
- Example: "You enter the dark hallway."

**Third Person Limited:**
- Single character's perspective per scene
- "He/she/they" pronouns
- Limited to that character's knowledge
- Example: "She wondered what he was thinking."

**Third Person Omniscient:**
- All-knowing narrator
- Multiple perspectives
- Can reveal any character's thoughts
- Example: "Meanwhile, across town, he pondered the same question."

### POV Consistency Rules

**Within Scenes:**
- Don't head-hop (switch POV mid-scene)
- Maintain chosen perspective throughout
- Filter information through POV character

**Between Scenes/Chapters:**
- Clearly mark POV shifts
- Use chapter breaks or section breaks
- Consider consistency: Same POV throughout vs. multiple POVs

**Common POV Errors:**
- ❌ "She felt angry. He sensed her irritation." (head-hopping in limited POV)
- ✓ "She felt angry. Her fists clenched." (stays in her POV)
- ✓ "She felt angry. He stepped back, sensing trouble." (showing his reaction, not his thoughts)

## Tense Consistency

### Narrative Tenses

**Past Tense:**
- Most common for fiction
- Natural storytelling feel
- Example: "He walked down the street."

**Present Tense:**
- Immediate, cinematic
- Creates urgency
- Example: "He walks down the street."

**Past Perfect:**
- Flashbacks within past tense narrative
- Example: "He walked down the street. He had been there before."

### Maintaining Tense

**Primary Rules:**
- Choose one primary tense for narrative
- Stick to it consistently
- Flashbacks: Use appropriate past perfect or clear markers
- Dialogue: Can be any tense (characters speak naturally)

**Common Tense Errors:**
- ❌ Shifting from past to present without reason
- ❌ Inconsistent use of past perfect in flashbacks
- ✓ Clear demarcation when changing time periods

## Punctuation Style Consistency

### Choose and Document:

**Oxford Comma:**
- YES: "red, white, and blue"
- NO: "red, white and blue"
- Decision: Choose one and maintain throughout

**Quotation Mark Style:**
- American: Periods and commas inside quotes
- British: Logical placement
- Decision: Follow one style guide

**Dashes:**
- Em dash (—): "She ran—fast as lightning—toward home."
- En dash (–): "pages 10–15"
- Hyphen (-): "well-known author"
- Consistency: Use correctly and uniformly

**Ellipsis:**
- Three dots: ...
- With spaces: . . .
- Decision: Choose one style

**Possessives:**
- Names ending in S:
  - "James's book" or "James' book"
  - Choose and maintain consistency

## Capitalization Consistency

### Title Capitalization
- Choose style: Title Case or Sentence case
- Chicago: Capitalize major words
- AP: Capitalize words 4+ letters
- Maintain throughout all headings

### Specific Terms
- Generic vs. proper nouns:
  - "the government" vs. "the Government"
  - "the king" vs. "King Henry"
- Document decisions for recurring terms

### Professional Titles
- When to capitalize:
  - "President Lincoln" (before name)
  - "the president" (generic reference)
- Maintain pattern throughout

## Dialogue Consistency

### Dialogue Tags
- Choose primary tags: "said", "asked"
- Avoid overuse of elaborate tags: "he opined", "she ejaculated"
- Maintain consistent tag placement

### Dialect and Accent
- If representing accent: Use sparingly and consistently
- Don't overdo phonetic spelling
- Maintain same patterns for each character
- Consider: Signal accent once, then use standard spelling

### Character Voice
- Each character should have distinct voice
- Vocabulary should match character
- Speech patterns should be consistent:
  - Formal vs. informal
  - Complete sentences vs. fragments
  - Verbal tics or catchphrases (used sparingly)

## Formatting Consistency

### Scene Breaks
- Choose marker: asterisks (*), space, ornament, etc.
- Use consistently throughout

### Chapter Headings
- Format consistently:
  - "Chapter 1" or "Chapter One" or "1"
  - With or without chapter titles
  - Formatting (centered, left-aligned, etc.)

### Emphasis
- Choose method: italics, bold, ALL CAPS
- Use consistently for same type of emphasis
- Don't overuse

### Numbers
- Spell out small numbers (one to ten) or use numerals (1-10)
- Be consistent with your choice
- Exceptions: Dates, times, measurements, money
