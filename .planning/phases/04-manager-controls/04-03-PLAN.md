# Phase 4 Test Event Data Setup Plan

## Objective
Create a comprehensive test event with all 8 reminder types enabled for testing the reminder system functionality.

## Context
- Phase 4: Manager Controls - reminder system is deployed and functional
- Need to test all 8 reminder types with proper scheduling
- Database schema includes events table with settings JSONB for reminder configuration
- 8 system templates are seeded in message_templates table

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create Test Organization
- Create a test organization for the test event
- Use organization_id for multi-tenant isolation

### Task 2: Create Test Event with All Reminders Enabled
- Create event with future dates (event_date, registration_open, registration_close)
- Enable all 8 reminder types in settings JSONB
- Configure proper timing for each reminder type
- Set up message templates for testing

### Task 3: Add Test Participants with Personal Schedules
- Create test participants (at least 3-5)
- Add personal schedules for each participant
- Ensure participants are properly linked to the test event

### Task 4: Verify Test Data Setup
- Confirm event exists with correct configuration
- Verify participants are properly associated
- Check reminder settings are correctly configured

## Success Criteria
- Test event created with valid future dates
- All 8 reminder types enabled in event settings
- Test participants added with personal schedules
- Event ID returned for UI testing
- All data properly linked in database

## Verification
- Check events table for test event
- Verify participants table has test participants
- Confirm event_participants junction table has correct entries
- Check schedules table for personal schedules
- Validate reminder settings in events.settings JSONB

## Output
- Event ID for the test event
- Summary of created test data
- Configuration details for testing
